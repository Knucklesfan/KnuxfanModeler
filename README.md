# KnuxfanModeler
This is a project that works in tandem with my game engine, currently located in [Knuxfan's Tetriminos](https://github.com/knucklesfan/SDLTris). It generates files for the .kmf format, or Knuxfan Model Format. 
As of now, this project isn't fully ready for use outside of experimental testing, but is documented within it's CPP files.
